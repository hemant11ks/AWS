1. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Virtual servers in the cloud. Example: Running a web server or a database server on an EC2 instance.
2. Lambda: Serverless compute service. Example: Processing images uploaded to S3 using a Lambda function.
3. ECS (Elastic Container Service): Container orchestration service. Example: Running a containerized web application on ECS.

Storage Services

1. S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage service. Example: Storing and serving images, videos, or files on a website.
2. EBS (Elastic Block Store): Block-level storage service. Example: Attaching an EBS volume to an EC2 instance for additional storage.
3. Glacier: Long-term data archiving service. Example: Archiving infrequently accessed data, such as backups or logs.

Database Services

1. RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed relational database service. Example: Running a MySQL or PostgreSQL database on RDS.
2. DynamoDB: NoSQL key-value and document database service. Example: Storing and retrieving large amounts of data, such as user profiles or game state.
3. DocumentDB: Document-oriented database service. Example: Storing and querying large amounts of semi-structured data, such as JSON documents.
